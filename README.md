# Neural-Network-using-numpy-and-pandas
This project is for understanding how a neural network works.I have implemented the algorithm with different hyperparamters:<br><br>
- Number of neurons in hidden layer
- type of activation:
  - sigmoid
  - tanh
  - ELU
  - RELU
  - Leaky RELU
  - softmax(for output layer)
- Different optimization algorithms
  - batch GD
  - mini-batch GD
  - SGD
<br><br>
Since GD algorithm has its own limitations and challenges like momentum or getting caught in local minima,we Will soon try to add more recent optmization methods like
- Adagrad
- Ada delta
- Adam
- RMS prop
<br><br>Will also try to modify /add code for a Multi label classifier
